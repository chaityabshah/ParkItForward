ParkIt Forward is an Android application, built at the GT College of Computing Student-Alumni Hackathon. The application's purpose is to connect GM car owners and help them find parking spots in busy urban areas where parking is a hassle. With ParkIt Forward, drivers pay less attention to the sides of the street, searching for parking, and focus more on driving the vehicle. Built using the GM API, Google Maps API, Android Studio and Microsoft Azure.
